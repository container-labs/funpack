[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/d0daac35b65f49c51068/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/container-labs/funpack/maintainability)

like `webpack`, but for functions

## into

the welcome to my npm page section

## install

because sometimes it's faster to copy and paste instead of type

```
npm install --save @containerlabs/funpack
```

or if you like to play with yarn

```
yarn add --save @containerlabs/funpack
```

# see it in action

aka give me the code to copy and paste

```
 funpack -e local
```
