like `webpack`, but for functions


## install

because sometimes it's faster to copy and paste instead of type

```
npm install --save @containerlabs/funpack
```

or if you like to play with yarn

```
yarn add --save @containerlabs/funpack
```

# see it in action

aka give me the code to copy and paste

```
 funpack -e local
```
